## File Overview

### ← script.js

This is where I added the JavaScript code for my game.

### ← assets

Drag in assets, like images, to add them to my project. All image files are uploaded to the `assets` folder. The url of the image will be `assets/example.jpg` or `assets/example.png`.

### ← index.html

The HTML file contains HTML code that sets up a webpage for our game. I also add libraries in this file using HTML tags.

### ← README.md

That's this file. This is the place to tell people more about what my game does and how I built it. 

### ← style.css

The CSS file adds styling rules to my content like changing colors and fonts. I did not use this file for my game and instead update the style of my game in the script.js file.
